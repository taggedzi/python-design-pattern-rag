# The Interpreter Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent

The Interpreter pattern provides a way to implement business logic by creating a language interpreter that uses an object-oriented approach. It is used when there is a language to interpret and the grammar is simple enough such that it can be implemented with a finite state machine.

## Problem It Solves

This pattern addresses the problem of how to handle complex grammars, especially where the syntax is not complicated but the semantics are complicated. This makes the code hard to maintain and understand. The Interpreter pattern provides an efficient way to evaluate sentences in a language.

## When to Use It

The Interpreter pattern should be used when there's a need for:

1. Evaluating simple or complex expressions representing languages.
2. Implementing a specialized domain-specific language (DSL).
3. Avoiding the overhead of parsing with a parser generator tool.
4. When efficiency is not a critical concern, as it can add complexity to your design.

## When NOT to Use It

The Interpreter pattern should not be used when:

1. The language's grammar is too complex and cannot be implemented with a finite state machine.
2. Efficiency is a crucial concern, as the overhead of parsing can become significant.
3. For simple expressions where you could use an expression tree or similar simpler constructs.

## How It Works

The Interpreter pattern consists of:

1. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for representing sentences in the language.
2. Context object to hold variables and their values.
3. Terminal Expressions represent individual elements of the language, like variables.
4. Non-terminal expressions combine terminal expressions and form larger structures.
5. The `interpret()` method is used to interpret the sentence or expression.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine you are a librarian who has books on different subjects but they all follow a common structure. You can use the Interpreter pattern to search for specific information in these books without knowing what each book contains, just like how an interpreter works with sentences in a language.

## Simplified Example

Consider the following Python code:

```python
context = Context({"x": 10, "y": 5})
expr = Add(Variable("x"), Subtract(Variable("y"), Variable("z")))   # x + (y - z)
print("Result:", expr.interpret(context))
```

In this example, `Add` and `Subtract` are non-terminal expressions that combine terminal expressions like `Variable` to form larger structures. The `interpret()` method is used to interpret the sentence or expression by returning the result of the addition or subtraction operation.
