Sure, here's how you can structure your lesson:

# The Interpreter Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The Interpreter pattern provides a way to execute an expression language where the grammar is defined in terms of classes and objects. It is used to define a grammatical representation for a language, and to interpret sentences in the language.

## Problem It Solves
This design pattern addresses the problem of how to parse expressions written in a formal language, like a programming language or a specialized domain-specific language. The pattern provides an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. 

## When to Use It
The Interpreter pattern is useful when you need to evaluate simple expressions, where the grammar of the expression is known at compile time and does not change during execution.

## When NOT to Use It
It's not a good idea to use the Interpreter pattern if:
- The grammar of your language changes frequently or isn't known until runtime.
- Your expressions are complex, with many different types of nodes and nonterminals. 

## How It Works
The Interpreter pattern works by defining classes for terminal symbols (like variables) and nonterminal symbols (like addition and subtraction). Each class implements an `interpret` method that interprets the expression in its own way. The context provides input for interpretation.

## Real-World Analogy
You can think of the Interpreter pattern as a kind of translator, where each word or symbol is interpreted differently based on its context. For example, if you're reading a book and see a word that you don't know, you might look it up in a dictionary to understand what it means.

## Simplified Example
Here's a simplified example:
```python
context = Context({"x": 10, "y": 5})
expr = Add(Variable("x"), Subtract(Variable("y"), Variable("z")))   # x + (y - z)
print("Result:", expr.interpret(context))
```
In this example, `Add` and `Subtract` are non-terminal expressions that interpret their operands in different ways. The variables "x", "y" and "z" are terminal expressions that interpret themselves based on the values they hold in the given context.
