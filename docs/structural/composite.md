# The Composite Pattern (Structural)

# The Composite Pattern (Structural Design Patterns)

## Intent

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients can treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Problem It Solves

The problem this pattern solves is related to how you would manage a complex hierarchy of objects, where each object could be either an individual (leaf) or a group of other objects (composite). The client code should not need to know whether the object it's dealing with is just a simple leaf or a more complicated composite.

## When to Use It

This pattern is particularly useful when you have a complex tree structure, and you want to treat all objects uniformly without having to write conditional statements for individual types of nodes. 

## When NOT to Use It

While the Composite Pattern can be very powerful, it should not be used if:
1. The object hierarchy is simple and does not require complex operations like addition or removal of components.
2. You do not need to treat all objects uniformly in a uniform way. 

## How It Works

The key classes involved are the Component class (abstract base class), Leaf class, and Composite class. The Component class has methods for adding, removing, and getting child components. If an object is a composite, it can have children; if not, it's a leaf. 

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine you are organizing your files in a cloud storage service. Each file could be considered a 'leaf', while each folder that contains other files (and possibly folders) is a 'composite'. You can add or remove files/folders without needing to know whether they're individual files or part of larger structures.

## Simplified Example

```python
# Leaf1 and Leaf2 are leaves, each containing just one file.
leaf1 = Leaf("A")
leaf2 = Leaf("B")
composite1 = Composite("Group1")  # This is a composite since it can contain other composites or leaves.
composite1.add(leaf1)
composite1.add(leaf2)

# Leaf3 is another leaf, and composite2 is also a composite containing composite1 and the new leaf.
leaf3 = Leaf("C")
composite2 = Composite("Group2")
composite2.add(composite1)  # This adds composite1 (the group of A and B files) to Group2.
composite2.add(leaf3)  # This adds the new file C to Group2.
```
