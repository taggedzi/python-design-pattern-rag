# The Builder Pattern (Creational)

## Intent
The Builder design pattern is a creational pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. It provides a simple interface to construct an object step by step, which makes it easier for developers to use and understand.

## Problem It Solves
In software development, there are often many ways to build an object. The problem is that each way may involve complex steps or operations, making the code hard to read and maintain. The Builder pattern solves this issue by providing a simple interface to construct an object step-by-step. This makes it easier for developers to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

## When to Use It
This pattern is best used when you need to build complex objects, especially those with many parts. The Builder pattern also helps in creating different representations of the same construction process. 

## When NOT to Use It
It should not be used if the object being constructed is simple and doesn't have many parts. Using a simpler approach like a constructor for small objects can be more straightforward.

## How It Works
The Builder pattern involves three main components: Product, Builder interface, and Director. The Product represents the complex object under construction, the Builder interface defines methods to construct the product step by step, and the Director is responsible for managing the process of using the builder to build the product. 

In this specific code example, we have a Product class that contains parts of the complex object, a Builder interface with abstract methods to add different parts to the product, and a ConcreteBuilder class which implements these methods. The Director class is optional and can be used to define the order in which to call building steps.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're constructing a complex house. Without using a Builder pattern, you might need to know every detail about each room (like how many windows, doors, etc.) before starting to build it. But with a Builder pattern, you could start by just knowing the basic foundation and then gradually add more details as you go along. This makes it easier for developers to use and understand complex object construction processes.

## Simplified Example
The simplified pseudocode or Python snippet would be:
```python
# Create a builder
builder = ConcreteBuilder()

# Use the director to build a product with the builder
director = Director(builder)

# Build a minimal viable product
director.build_minimal_viable_product()
print("Minimal product:", builder.get_product().list_parts())

# Build a full featured product
director.build_full_featured_product()
print("Full product:", builder.get_product().list_parts())
```
