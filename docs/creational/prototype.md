# The Prototype Pattern (Creational)

# The Prototype Pattern (Creational Design Patterns)

## Intent

The prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows for creating objects by cloning an existing object, rather than instantiating new ones from scratch. This can be particularly useful when the creation of complex or large objects are costly in terms of resources and time. 

## Problem It Solves

This pattern addresses the problem of object creation where a new instance is created based on an existing one. The existing instance serves as a prototype, providing initial values for the new object. This can be particularly useful when creating complex or large objects which are costly to create from scratch. 

## When to Use It

This pattern is especially effective in situations where:
1. Object creation is resource-intensive and time-consuming.
2. The same type of object needs to be created multiple times with minor changes.
3. A class definition is complex or large, and instantiating it directly would be costly.

## When NOT to Use It

Misuse of this pattern could lead to code that is harder to understand and maintain. This should only be used when the objects being cloned are significantly complex and/or numerous.

## How It Works

The key classes involved in this pattern are `Prototype` and its subclasses like `Shape`. The `Prototype` class provides a `clone()` method that returns a deep copy of the current object using Python's built-in `copy.deepcopy()` function. 

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine you have a blue shape at position (10,20) on your canvas. You want to create another identical blue shape at a different location. Instead of manually setting the color and position for each new instance, you can clone the original shape and move it around without having to re-enter those details every time.

## Simplified Example

Here's a simplified version of how this pattern might be used:

```python
original = Shape("blue", (10, 20))
clone = original.clone()
clone.move(5, -5)
print(clone) # prints "Shape(color=green, position=(15,-5))"
```
