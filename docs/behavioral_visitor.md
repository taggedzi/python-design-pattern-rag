# The Visitor Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The Visitor pattern allows you to perform an operation on each element of a complex data structure without modifying the classes of those elements. It's useful for separating concerns across many element types.

## Problem It Solves
Traditional iteration over collections of objects (like lists or trees) often involves checking the type of each object and then performing an operation specific to that type, leading to a lot of conditional logic that can be difficult to maintain. The Visitor pattern addresses this by allowing you to define new operations on elements without changing their classes.

## When to Use It
The Visitor pattern is useful in scenarios where there are multiple types of objects and each object needs to perform different actions based on its type. This includes data structures like trees or graphs, but can also be used with any other kind of complex structure that contains heterogeneous elements.

## When NOT to Use It
While the Visitor pattern is useful for separating concerns across multiple types of objects, it's not a suitable choice if you only have a few different object types and their operations are simple enough to fit into one or two methods. The pattern can also be overkill if your data structure isn't complex enough to benefit from its complexity.

## How It Works
The Visitor pattern involves three key components: the `Visitor` interface, which declares a set of methods corresponding to possible operations on elements; the `Element` interface, which declares an `accept()` method that takes a `Visitor` as a parameter; and concrete `Visitor` classes implementing all the possible combinations of operations.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're at a party with several types of guests (the elements), each having different behaviors (their own methods). Now, if there are new guest types that need to perform special actions, you can simply add them as new concrete visitors without changing the existing guest classes. This is similar to how the Visitor pattern allows you to extend your data structure's functionality without modifying its elements.

## Simplified Example
Here's a simplified example of the Visitor pattern:

```python
class ElementA:
    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit_element_a(self)

class ElementB:
    def accept(self, visitor):
        visitor.visit<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>ElementB(self)
