# The Observer Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The Observer pattern provides a way to communicate changes within one object hierarchy. It is commonly used for event notification, where an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers), and notifies them automatically of any state changes. 

## Problem It Solves
This design pattern addresses the problem of having complex dependencies between objects so that when one object's state changes, all other dependent objects are updated automatically. This is particularly useful in event-driven systems where multiple components need to react to events triggered by a single action.

## When to Use It
The Observer pattern should be used when there is a one-to-many relationship between objects such as if you have an application that needs to notify users of updates, or if you're building a chat app where multiple clients need to receive messages from the server in real time.

## When NOT to Use It
The Observer pattern should not be used when:
1. Efficiency is a concern because it can lead to unnecessary object interactions. 
2. The relationship between objects is too complex and hard to manage, causing developers to lose track of the dependencies.
3. If you need strict control over when notifications are sent out.

## How It Works
The Observer pattern involves three key components:
1. **Subject** (Observable): maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
2. **Observer**: defines an updating interface for objects that should be notified of changes in the subject's state.
3. **Concrete Observer**: implements the Observer updating interface to keep its state consistent with the subject'<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>/
