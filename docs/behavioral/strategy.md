# The Strategy Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The strategy pattern is a design pattern that allows selecting an algorithm at runtime. It's useful when you want to avoid multiple conditional branches, as it provides a way to encapsulate different algorithms into separate classes and makes them interchangeable within the context of your application.

## Problem It Solves
This pattern addresses the problem of having complex control flow in code. When we have several related or distinct ways to perform an action, but not all at once, it can become hard to manage with multiple conditional statements. This pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, put each one into its own class, and make them interchangeable.

## When to Use It
This pattern is especially effective when:
1. You want to choose the algorithm or strategy used at runtime based on specific conditions.
2. Multiple related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategy lets a family of algorithms be chosen at runtime by delegating the decision to the client, giving more flexibility and reusability to your code.
3. When you need to use different variants of an algorithm within an algorithm (strategy pattern inside strategy pattern).

## When NOT to Use It
Misuse of this pattern can lead to a lot of small classes that do not contribute much to the overall functionality, making it harder to maintain and understand. Also, if there are no clear differences between objects or clients in terms of behavior, using this pattern may be overkill.

## How It Works
The Strategy Pattern is structured with three components: 
1. `Strategy` interface - This defines a common protocol for all concrete strategies. The context uses this to call the algorithm defined by each concrete strategy.
2. Concrete strategies - These are classes that implement the `Strategy` interface and provide different implementation of the algorithm.
3. Context - This is the class that uses the Strategy: It maintains a reference to a Strategy object, communicates with it, may define an interface that allows Strategy access its data.

The key classes or functions involved are the strategy interface (`Strategy`), concrete strategies (like `AscendingSortStrategy`, `DescendingSortStrategy`, etc.), and the context class (`SortContext`). 

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine a traveler. He has different ways of traveling like by car, by plane, or by train. Now if he wants to change his mode of transportation, it's not like changing clothes in our body - we just put on new clothes (or switch off the old one). Similarly, the traveler can easily switch between these modes of transportation without affecting other parts of his journey.

## Simplified Example
```python
class Strategy:  # The strategy interface
    def execute(self):
        pass

# Concrete strategies
class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):  
    def execute(self):
        return "ConcreteStrategyA"

class ConcreteStrategyB(Strategy):
    def execute(self):
        return "ConcreteStrategyB"

class Context:  # The context
    def __init__(self, strategy: Strategy) -> None:
        self._strategy = strategy

    @property
    def strategy(self) -> Strategy:
        return self._strategy

    @strategy.setter
    def strategy(self, strategy: Strategy) -> None:
        self._strategy = strategy

    def context_interface(self):
        return self._strategy.execute()
```
