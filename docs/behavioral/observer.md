# The Observer Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent

The observer pattern is a software design pattern where an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes. This pattern is particularly useful for implementing distributed event handling systems.

## Problem It Solves

It addresses issues related to communication between objects when one object (subject) needs to inform other objects about the change in its state. 

## When to Use It

The Observer pattern should be used in situations where there is a need for automatic updating of multiple dependent components or systems, especially when changes are made in one component and it's necessary to update others as well.

## When NOT to Use It

It’s not recommended to use the Observer pattern if you don't have more than a few objects that should be updated. The overhead of maintaining an observer list can become significant with many observers, making this pattern less efficient for such cases.

## How It Works

The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them when its state changes. Each observer is an object implementing the Observer interface which has a `update()` method that gets called by the Subject whenever it changes state. 

In this example, the Subject class provides methods for attaching (adding) or detaching (removing) observers from its list and notifying them of any change in state. The ConcreteObserver is an Observer which implements the `update()` method to handle notifications received by the subject.

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine a news agency with many subscribers (observers). When there's a breaking news, it notifies all its subscribers about the update instantly. 

## Simplified Example

```python
subject.attach(observer1) # Attaching observer1 to subject
subject.attach(observer2) # Attaching observer2 to subject

subject.notify("State has changed") # Notifying all observers about state change

subject.detach(observer1) # Detaching observer1 from subject
```
