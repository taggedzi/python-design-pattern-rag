# The Visitor Pattern (Behavioral Patterns)

## Intent
The Visitor pattern allows you to add new operations to classes without changing their source code, essentially separating what is done from how it's done. It's useful for structuring and organizing the code in a way that makes it easy to add new behaviors or modify existing ones.

## Problem It Solves
The Visitor pattern addresses the problem of adding functionality to classes without modifying those classes themselves, which can be complex and error-prone when you're dealing with many different types of objects. 

## When to Use It
This pattern is particularly effective in scenarios where there are a large number of class hierarchies that need additional operations applied uniformly across all instances of the classes. For instance, if you have an application that includes a variety of different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, etc.), and you want to add new behaviors like calculating their areas or drawing them on the screen, it would be inefficient to modify each shape class itself.

## When NOT to Use It
Misuse of this pattern can lead to code that is hard to maintain and understand. If your classes are simple enough (i.e., they don't have a lot of methods), or if the additional operations you need to add aren't complex, it might be better to just modify the necessary classes directly.

## How It Works
The Visitor pattern involves defining an interface for all types of visitors that can visit different kinds of elements in your object structure. Each element then has a method `accept()` which takes a visitor and delegates the actual work to it. The concrete visitor implements these methods, performing the required operations on the appropriate type of elements.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you have a zoo where there are different types of animals (like Lions, Tigers, Bears) that can make noise. If you want to add new functionality like "make a sound", it would be inefficient to modify each animal class itself because there might be many more types of animals in the future. Instead, you create an interface for all types of visitors (like a person who listens to the sounds), and then have each type of animal accept these visitors.

## Simplified Example
Here's a simplified pseudocode representation:
```python
# Visitor interface
class Visitor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def visit_element_a(self, element: ElementA) -> None:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def visit_element_b(self, element: ElementB) -> None:
        pass

# Concrete visitor
class ConcreteVisitor(Visitor):
    def visit_element_a(self, element: ElementA) -> None:
        print(f"Visitor: Processing {element.operation_a()}")
    
    def visit_element_b(self, element: ElementB) -> None:
        print(f"Visitor: Processing {element.operation_b()}")
```
