# The Memento Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The Memento design pattern is a software design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo operation). It is used when we want to capture and store the current state of an object so it can be restored later, without violating encapsulation. This pattern is especially useful for implementing undo mechanisms in applications.

## Problem It Solves
The Memento Pattern solves problems related to preserving the previous states of objects while allowing them to go back to those states if necessary. This problem often arises when we have a complex system where state changes are frequent and need to be tracked, but also need an easy way to undo these changes without violating encapsulation.

## When to Use It
The Memento Pattern is most effective in situations where you want to provide the ability to undo operations on objects. This could be within a text editor application or any other scenario where users might wish to undo their actions. 

## When NOT to Use It
Mementos should not be used when the state of an object changes frequently, as this would mean storing and managing many memento objects which can quickly consume memory resources. Also, care must be taken that the Memento pattern does not violate encapsulation by exposing internal states. 

## How It Works
The Memento Pattern involves three key components: Originator (the object whose state changes frequently), Caretaker (manages the mementos and provides an interface for retrieving them when needed), and Memento (which stores the state of the originator). 

In this specific code, `TextEditor` is the Originator. It writes text and has methods to save its current state as a Memento and restore it from a previous Memento. The `History` class acts as Caretaker, storing all the mementos (previous states) of the TextEditor. 

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're writing a novel or an essay. You make mistakes along the way and want to be able to correct them without losing your progress. This is similar to how the Memento pattern allows us to save our work (the state of the TextEditor) and go back to it if we need to.

## Simplified Example
Here's a simplified example:
```python
editor = TextEditor()
history = History()

# Write some text and save its current state
editor.write("Hello, ")
history.backup(editor.save())

# Continue writing more text and save its state again
editor.write("world")
print("Current content:", editor.get_content())  # Outputs "Hello, world"

# Oops, we made a mistake. Let's undo our last change by restoring the previous state
editor.restore(history.undo())
print("After undo:", editor.get_content())  # Outputs "Hello,"
```
