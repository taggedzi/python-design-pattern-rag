# The Proxy Pattern (Structural)

## Intent
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is used when we want to provide a simplified interface to complex subsystems, manage remote services, or restrict / control access to objects.

## Problem It Solves
It allows us to provide a substitute/placeholder for another object. This can be useful in situations where the real subject (like an object that is resource-intensive) needs to be initialized lazily when it's actually needed, or if we want to control access to the object.

## When to Use It
This pattern should be used when:
1. We need to provide a simplified interface for complex subsystems.
2. Remote services are involved and we want to manage them in a simple way.
3. Access to objects needs to be controlled or restricted.

## When NOT to Use It
It's not recommended to use the Proxy pattern when:
1. The real subject is small, simple, or does not have complex initialization logic.
2. We need direct access to the object and its methods frequently.
3. There are no performance issues associated with creating a proxy class.

## How It Works
The Proxy class has an interface identical to the RealSubject's. When a client wants to use the real subject, it uses the Proxy instead. The Proxy intercepts requests before they reach the real subject and can perform additional actions like logging or controlling access. 

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you are at a library where books are available in different languages but you only have an English dictionary. You could consider each book as your 'RealSubject' (the actual content) and the dictionary as your 'Proxy'. The Proxy will translate for you when you need to read, rather than having to do it yourself.

## Simplified Example
Here is a simplified example of how the code might look:

```python
class Subject:
    def request(self) -> None:
        pass  # Implementation here...

class Proxy(Subject):
    def __init__(self, real_subject: Subject) -<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜> None:
        self._real_subject = real_subject
    
    def request(self) -> None:
        if self.check_access():
            self._real_subject.request()
            self.log_access()
```
In this example, the `Proxy` class has a method called `request()` that first checks access and then logs it before forwarding the request to the real subject.
