# The Memento Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The Memento pattern is used to restore an object to its previous state, without revealing the details of that state to the outside world. It provides a way to return to the state before taking undesirable actions in response to certain events.

## Problem It Solves
It addresses issues related to encapsulation and information preservation. The pattern allows for an object's internal state to be saved, so it can be restored later without violating encapsulation. This is useful for implementing features like undo/redo or saving previous states of a complex object.

## When to Use It
The Memento pattern should be used when you want to save and restore the previous state of an object, especially in situations where it's not feasible or practical to do so directly. This could include complex objects with numerous internal states, or when you need to preserve a significant amount of history information for later use.

## When NOT to Use It
The Memento pattern should not be used if the state of an object is too complex and saving it all together would make your code harder to understand and maintain. Also, if the mementos are being created frequently (e.g., in response to user actions), you might end up with a large number of them, which could slow down your application.

## How It Works
The Memento pattern involves three key components: 
- `Memento` class that stores the internal state of an object and provides access methods for it.
- `Originator` class (the object whose state is being saved) has a method to create mementos, restore their states, and save/load them.
- `Caretaker` class that keeps track of these memento objects and provides methods for saving and restoring the mementos.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're writing an essay in a word processor. You write your first draft, then realize it needs more detail. Instead of losing all your work (which would be like discarding the Memento), you can save that state (the Memento) and continue from where you left off later.

## Simplified Example
Here's a simplified example in Python:

```python
class TextEditorMemento:
    def __init__(self, text):
        self._text = text

    @property
    def text(self):
        return self._text

class TextEditor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._text = ''

    def write(self, text):
        self._text += text

    def save(self):
        return TextEditorMemento(self._text)

    def restore(self, memento):
        self._text = memento.text

# Example usage:
editor = TextEditor()
history = []  # Caretaker for Mementos

editor.write('Hello, ')
history.append(editor.save())  # backup the state

editor.write('world')
print(f"Current content: {editor.text}")

# undo/restore previous state
editor.restore(history.pop())  
print(f"After undo: {editor.text}")
```
