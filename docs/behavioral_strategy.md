# The Strategy Pattern (Behavioral)

## Intent
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the program to choose the algorithm it needs at runtime based on specific requirements or conditions.

## Problem It Solves
Imagine you are writing a sorting function in Python that sorts lists of numbers in different ways: ascending order, descending order, or unique values only. You could use multiple conditional statements inside your main function to handle these different scenarios. However, this approach is not scalable and maintainable as the number of conditions increases.

## When to Use It
The Strategy pattern should be used when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in their behavior. This makes them hard to manage and understand. The pattern allows for easy addition or modification of behaviors without modifying existing code, which is particularly useful in large projects with many developers contributing to the codebase.

## When NOT to Use It
The Strategy pattern should not be used when:
- You need a one-time behavior that doesn't change frequently.
- The classes have very different behaviors and you don't want them to share any common interface.

## How It Works
In the Strategy pattern, there are three key components:
1. **Strategy Interface**: This is an abstract base class with a single method for executing the algorithm. All concrete strategies must implement this method.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: These classes implement the strategy interface and define the specific behavior of each algorithm. In our example, `AscendingSortStrategy`, `DescendingSortStrategy`, and `UniqueSortStrategy` are examples of these.
3. **Context**: This class maintains a reference to a Concrete Strategy object and communicates with it through the strategy interface. It defines an interface that lets the client pass in different strategies and control their execution. In our example, `SortContext` is the context class.

## Real-World Analogy
Imagine you are at a restaurant where you have multiple menus (strategies). You can choose to eat any dish from each menu based on your preference or what's available in that particular menu. This selection process (the strategy) allows you to enjoy different cuisines without having to change the location of the restaurant.

## Simplified Example
Here is a simplified example:
```python
class Strategy:
    def execute(self, data):
        pass

class ConcreteStrategyA(Strategy):
    def execute(self, data):
        return sorted(data)  # Ascending order sorting

class Context:
    def __init__(self, strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy
    
    def set_strategy(self, strategy):
        self._strategy = strategy
        
    def execute_strategy(self, data):
        return self._strategy.execute(data)
```
In this example, `ConcreteStrategyA` is a sorting algorithm (the strategy), and the context maintains a reference to one of these strategies and communicates with it through the `Strategy` interface.
