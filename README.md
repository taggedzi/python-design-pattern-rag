# 🧠 Python Design Patterns for RAG Systems

This repository contains a structured, AI-enhanced collection of Python code examples for major software design patterns — formatted and optimized for use in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, such as those powered by **Open WebUI + Ollama**.

All pattern implementations have been:
- Cleaned and normalized
- Chunked into single-file Markdown documents
- Optionally enriched with **Codellama-based docstrings and summaries**
- Indexed into a machine- and human-readable `summary_index.json`

## 💡 Features

- ✂️ **File-Level Chunking**: Related classes/functions in each `.py` file are preserved as a single chunk
- 🧠 **Ollama Integration**: Enhancements use [Codellama](https://ollama.com/library/codellama) or other local models to add docstrings + summaries
- 🗃️ **Front Matter Metadata**: Every chunk includes pattern name, file source, and identifiers for easy indexing
- 🔍 **Summary Index**: Machine-readable JSON index to power GUIs or search

## 🛠️ How to Use in Open WebUI + Ollama

### 1. **Prepare Your Knowledge Base**

In Open WebUI:
- Go to the **"Knowledge"** tab
- Click **"New Knowledge Base"**
- Choose **Folder** and upload the `chunks/` directory

### 2. **Query with Context Awareness**

Ask things like:
```text
How do I implement the Builder pattern in Python?
What’s the difference between Singleton and Borg patterns?
Show me an example of the Strategy pattern.
```
Your RAG system will retrieve context-rich, formatted answers from these enhanced documents.

### 3. **Search or Visualize with summary_index.json**
Use the `summary_index.json` to:
- Build UIs with sidebar navigation
- Search patterns by type or file
- Feed summaries into tooltips or documentation

## 🚀 Scripts

### `rag_chunker.py`
- Chunk Python files into `.md`
- Optionally enhance using a local Ollama model

**Usage:**
```bash
python rag_chunker.py ./source-code ./chunks --enhance --keep-original
```

### `summary_index_generator.py`
- Generate the `summary_index.json` from your `.md` chunks

**Usage:**
```bash
python summary_index_generator.py ./chunks ./summary_index.json
```

## 🔄 Supported Patterns (Examples)

- ✅ Singleton
- ✅ Factory
- ✅ Builder
- ✅ Strategy
- ✅ Observer
- ✅ Decorator
- ✅ Adapter
- ✅ Command
- ✅ Facade

> New patterns can be added by running `rag_chunker.py` on new source files.
