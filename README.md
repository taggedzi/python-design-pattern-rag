# üß† Python Design Patterns and RAG files for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in other AI systems

This repository contains a structured, AI-enhanced collection of Python code demonstrating the major software design patterns in python.

This project ALSO includes formatted and optimized Markdown files for use in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, such as those powered by **Open WebUI + Ollama** that describes the patterns in a way that is optimized for use in **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, such as those powered by **Open WebUI + Ollama**.

All pattern implementations have been:

- Cleaned and normalized and documented with docstrings and comments.
- Chunked into single-file Markdown documents
- Optionally enriched with **AI-based docstrings and summaries**
- Indexed into a machine- and human-readable `summary_index.json`

## üí° Features

- ‚úÇÔ∏è **File-Level Chunking**: Related classes/functions in each `.py` file are preserved as a single chunk
- üß† **Ollama Integration**: Enhancements use [Falcon 3](https://ollama.com/library/falcon3) or other local models to add docstrings + summaries
- üóÉÔ∏è **Front Matter Metadata**: Every chunk includes pattern name, file source, and identifiers for easy indexing
- üîç **Summary Index**: Machine-readable JSON index to power GUIs or search

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use in Open WebUI + Ollama

### 1. **Prepare Your Knowledge Base**

In Open WebUI:

- Go to the **"Knowledge"** tab
- Click **"New Knowledge Base"**
- Choose **Folder** and upload the `chunks/` directory

### 2. **Query with Context Awareness**

Ask things like:

```text
How do I implement the Builder pattern in Python?
What‚Äôs the difference between Singleton and Borg patterns?
Show me an example of the Strategy pattern.
```

Your RAG system will retrieve context-rich, formatted answers from these enhanced documents.

### 3. **Search or Visualize with summary_index.json**

Use the `summary_index.json` to:

- Build UIs with sidebar navigation
- Search patterns by type or file
- Feed summaries into tooltips or documentation

---

## üîÑ Supported Patterns (Examples)

- ‚úÖ Singleton
- ‚úÖ Factory
- ‚úÖ Builder
- ‚úÖ Strategy
- ‚úÖ Observer
- ‚úÖ Decorator
- ‚úÖ Adapter
- ‚úÖ Command
- ‚úÖ Facade

> New patterns can be added by running `rag_chunker.py` on new source files.

**Everything below here is ONLY needed if you wish to contributed to the project or build the RAG files yourself.**

## üì• Contributing

Contributions are welcome! You can:

- Add new design pattern examples
- Improve docstrings or summaries
- Enhance scripts or tooling

Open issues or pull requests for improvements.

## Setup

1. Verify you have Python and pip installed. The project runs on python Python 3.10+ and pip. See [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) for installation instructions.

2. Use git to clone this repository. `git clone https://github.com/taggedzi/python-design-pattern-rag.git` or download the zip archive and extract it to your desired location.

3. Navigate to the project root directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. Install Ollama and run it locally. Files can be downloaded from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/download) for thier download options.

5. Download the `falcon3:7b` model locally. See [Falcon 3](https://ollama.com/library/falcon3) for more information.

6. Use Ollama to create the custom model locally. See [ollama/README.md](./ollama/README.md) for more information.

7. To build ALL all the Markdown files run:
   ```bash
   python chunk_all_patterns.py
   ```

8. To build a single file run:
   ```bash
    python rag_chunker.py ./patterns/<type>/<pattern>.py chunks --enhance
   ```

## üöÄ Scripts

### `rag_chunker.py`

- Chunk Python files into `.md`
- Optionally enhance using a local Ollama model

**Usage:**

```bash
python rag_chunker.py ./patterns/<type>/<pattern>.py ./chunks --enhance
```

For more information on this script, please refer to the source code, or call the script itself with the `--help` option.

### `summary_index_generator.py`

- Generate the `summary_index.json` from your `.md` chunks

**Usage:**

```bash
python summary_index_generator.py ./chunks ./summary_index.json
```
